# DataFestAfrica---Tweets-Analysis

DataFestAfrica 2022 was the first ever event that showcase all career professions within the data space in Africa. The event was on the 14th and 15th of October 2022 at the University of Lagos, Akoka-Yaba, Nigeria. The event sent twitter buzzing and got everyone talking about it.

To further dive deep into what people were saying about the event, I used the Tweepy API to gather tweets from twitter using the hashtags - DFA22, DataFestAfrica, DataFestAfrica22 and DataFestAfrica2022 - and carried out an analyss of the tweets.
